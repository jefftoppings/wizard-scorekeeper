# wizard-scorekeeper

In this project, I created a GUI that keeps score of the card game "Wizard". It was created in python3 using the tkinter module.

To launch the app, download all files and run "gui.pyw" for console free, or "gui.py" which includes the console. 

I also made the app run in the console without a GUI. This can be launched by running "play_in_console.py".
